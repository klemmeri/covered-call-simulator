# covered-call-simulator
Interactive covered call simulator for Substack readers (beta)
This is an educational simulator, not trading advice.
Prices are synthetic and generated from stochastic processes.
## Output files

When the simulator finishes, it creates an `output` folder **in the same directory as the script** and writes one Excel workbook there:

Nothing is written elsewhere on your system.  
If you move the script to a different folder, the output will appear there instead.
Note: The output file is saved in an 'output' folder next to this script.
